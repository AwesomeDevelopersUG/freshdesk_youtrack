# YouTrack FreshPlug

This application allows you to integrate YouTrack into your Freshdesk helpdesk.

## Prerequisies


* You must have REST enabled on your YouTrack (which is by default)
* Allow CORS from the domain, where you have your helpdesk (e.g.: support.mycompany.com)
* Have a field in YouTrack, numeric or string type, where you store the ticket id of a Freshdesk ticket


## How to use


Paste this piece of code as the Freshdesk custom app (FreshPlug)

```html
<div style="margin-top: 10px">
  <div id="youtrack-widget-container" data-yt-url="https://<your youtrack url>/"
    data-fdesk-ticket="{{ ticket.id }}" data-fdesk-field="<name of the field you use in YouTrack">
  </div>
  <script>
    (function() {
      var a = document.createElement("script");
      a.src = "http://cdn.rawgit.com/AwesomeDevelopersUG/freshdesk_youtrack/master/dist/app.js";
      document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(a)
	})()
  </script>
</div>
```

There are three data attributes:

* data-yt-url: Url of your issue tracker, e.g. https://issues.company.com/
* data-fdesk-ticket: This is the placeholder to be replaced by Freshdesk on ticket edit page
* data-fdesk-field: Name of the field in YouTrack that references the freshdesk issue (e.g. Freshdesk).

## Development

If you wish to develop this further, just:

* close
* npm install
* npm start (app is now served on port 3000)

To build the updated app: npm build_production


## Contributions

Very welcome, this has been put together very quickly, so the code is not especially nice. It works though.
